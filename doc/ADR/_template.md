# ADR template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

We extended this Template with ```Implementation Details``` (optional)

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title

## Status

What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Implementation Details

(Optional) How was this Decision implemented. I.e. Uml Diagrams, Code etc.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
